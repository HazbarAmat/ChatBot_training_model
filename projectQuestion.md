# CahtBot 
## Write a program that acts as a chatbot for any of your selected domains (e.g., help desk, consultation). You need the main keywords and related variables in your domain to obtain the expected questions and the proposed answers. For example,

Chatbot: Good Morning, I am Andreo, a chatbot to help you to give a quick medical advice
User: Good morning

Chatbot: How are you today 
User: I am fine, Thank you

Chatbot: How can I help you
User: I have a headache

Chatbot: Did you sleep well
User: Yes

Chatbot: Did you take Panadol
User: No

Chatbot: I advice to take Panadol.
User: Thanks    

You may need a trimmer and if you prefer to use Python, you can use some useful libraries such as  NLTK and FlashText library. You may also use tokenize module. 
 
You can get benefit of the user from some words that your chatbot do not understand and add it to your dictionary. For example


User: Do I have alternatives?
Chatbot: What do you mean by alternatives?

User: Choices
Chatbot: Thank you, Yes you have.

Your chatbot can now add the word of alternatives with other meaning of choices in its dictionary, so that next time, if the user says

User: What are my alternatives

Chatbot: Sleep, read or play football.
